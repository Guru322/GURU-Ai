## 0.12.0 (Dec 12, 2015 10:39pm)

- Breaking change: Problems with upper-case letters in npm is causing
  us to rename the package, so have renamed package to "jsonpath-plus"
  (there are already package with lower-case "jsonpath" or "json-path").
  The new name also reflects that there have been changes to the
  original spec.

  with upper-case letters is causing us to rename to "jsonpath-plus"

- Docs: Give warning in README that problems in npm with upper-case letters
  is causing us to rename to "jsonpath-plus" (next version will actually
  apply the change).

## 0.11.0 (Dec 12, 2015)

- Breaking change: For unwrapped results, return `undefined` instead
  of `false` upon failure to find path (to allow distinguishing of
  `undefined`--a non-allowed JSON value--from the valid JSON values,
  `null` or `false`) and return the exact value upon falsy single
  results (in order to allow return of `null`)
- Deprecated: Use of `jsonPath.eval()`; use new class-based API instead
- Feature: AMD export
- Feature: By using `self` instead of `window` export, allow JSONPath
  to be trivially imported into web workers, without breaking
  compatibility in normal scenarios. See [MDN on self](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/self)
- Feature: Offer new class-based API and object-based arguments (with
  option to run new queries via `evaluate()` method without resupplying config)
- Feature: Allow new `preventEval=true` and `autostart=false` option
- Feature: Allow new callback option to allow a callback function to execute as
  each final result node is obtained
- Feature: Allow type operators: JavaScript types (`@boolean()`, `@number()`,
  `@string()`), other fundamental JavaScript types (`@null()`, `@object()`,
  `@array()`), the JSONSchema-added type, `@integer()`, and the following
  non-JSON types that can nevertheless be used with JSONPath when querying
  non-JSON JavaScript objects (`@undefined()`, `@function()`, `@nonFinite()`).
  Finally, `@other()` is made available in conjunction with a new callback
  option, `otherTypeCallback`, can be used to allow user-defined type
  detection (at least until JSON Schema awareness may be provided).
- Feature: Support "parent" and "parentProperty" for resultType along with
  "all" (which also includes "path" and "value" together)
- Feature: Support custom `@parent`, `@parentProperty`, `@property` (in
  addition to custom property `@path`) inside evaluations
- Feature: Support a custom operator (`~`) to allow grabbing of property names
- Feature: Support `$` for retrieval of root, and document this as well as
  `$..` behavior
- Feature: Expose cache on `JSONPath.cache` for those who wish to preserve and
  reuse it
- Feature: Expose class methods `toPathString` for converting a path as array
  into a (normalized) path as string and `toPathArray` for the reverse (though
  accepting unnormalized strings as well as normalized)
- Fix: Allow `^` as property name
- Fix: Support `.` within properties
- Fix: `@path` in index/property evaluations

## 0.10.0 (Oct 23, 2013)

- Feature: Support for parent selection via `^`
- Feature: Access current path via `@path` in test statements
